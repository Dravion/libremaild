Native E-Mail &amp; Collaboration server 

LibremailD

LibremailD is a communications server designed for on-premise environments. The goal of the project is to enable edge-computing scenarios efficiently in small to medium-sized infrastructures.

The project deliberately follows a native approach and does not rely on virtualization or container technologies. This design decision is fundamental to the architecture of LibremailD. While the software may be deployed in various environments, proposals to migrate the project to alternative programming languages, runtime environments, or platform concepts are outside the scope of the project.

LibremailD is implemented in C99 and released under the Apache License 2.0. These choices were made deliberately for both technical and licensing reasons. For use cases that explicitly depend on virtualization or containerization, numerous other projects with a dedicated focus already exist.
